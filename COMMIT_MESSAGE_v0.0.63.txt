feat: SVG logo, keyboard page, UI polish (v0.0.63)

A heartfelt thank you to westlicht for creating PER|FORMER - it has been an integral
part of my modular system for years! I hope POW|FORMER does justice to the original
vision and breathes fresh life into this incredible sequencer.

Major UI/UX improvements focused on startup experience and visual refinement.

## Startup Screen Redesign
- Convert PEW_FORMER_LOGO.svg to efficient fillRect() code (87√ó18px, 45 rectangles)
- Add 6 animated space invaders (16√ó16px) with odd/even bobbing motion
- Enlarge heart symbols to 9√ó7px (was 5√ó5) with proper text alignment (y-4 offset)
- Create svg_to_logo_converter.py tool for designer‚Üícode workflow with ASCII preview

## Keyboard Page (New)
- Implement proper 2-octave piano layout (14 white keys, 10 black keys)
- Black key positions: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13] (no keys after E or B)
- Add persistent last-note-played display
- Relocate track/root/octave info to bottom of window
- Increase key sizes by 3px for better touch targets

## Layout Improvements
- Fix pattern number positioning (y+7 for proper height - subtract moves UP)
- Implement dynamic two-column list sizing with content-aware width calculation
- Add Canvas.textWidth() method for precise layout measurements
- Improve visual hierarchy across all list-based pages

## Technical Details
- Memory: 361028 bytes text (+776 from base v0.0.50, -384 from v0.0.62)
- Files: 38 changed, +1865 insertions, -398 deletions
- Major changes:
  - StartupPage.cpp: +395 lines (SVG logo, space invaders, hearts)
  - KeyboardPage.cpp/h: New files (2-octave piano implementation)
  - ListPage.cpp: +43 lines (dynamic column sizing)
  - Canvas.cpp/h: +23 lines (textWidth() method)

## Build System
- Creates svg_to_logo_converter.py for SVG‚ÜíC++ conversion
- Generates UPDATE.DAT ‚Üí ~/Desktop/UPDATE_16TRACKS_MINIMAL.DAT
- Build script: ~/build-performer.sh

Built upon PEW|FORMER (djphazer/performer) with 16-track support, 8 LFO modulators,
and microtiming recording from commits 84ec511 and earlier.

Includes jackpf's improvements integrated via Phazerville fork:
- Noise reduction algorithms
- Shape improvements
- Enhanced MIDI implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL: Community testing welcome! Many new features need validation.
Please test thoroughly and report issues.

Changelog: See CHANGELOG_v0.0.63.md for full details.
