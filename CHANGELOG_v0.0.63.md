## üíô A Heartfelt Thank You

First and foremost, a **huge thank you** to **westlicht** (Simon Kallweit) for creating the original PER|FORMER sequencer. This incredible instrument has been such an integral part of my modular system for years now! The generosity of open-sourcing this beast of a sequencer has enabled not just my own creative work, but an entire community of musicians and developers to push the boundaries of what's possible.

I hope with POW|FORMER I can do justice to your original vision and breathe some fresh life into this amazing platform while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with open source development. Thank you for creating something so special and sharing it with the world!

## Executive Summary

This release brings major UI/UX improvements focused on startup experience and visual polish. Building on extensive 16-track, modulator, and microtiming features from v0.0.50-0.0.62, this version refines the user interface with professionally converted SVG logo, enhanced visual feedback, and improved layouts.

**Key Highlights**:
- SVG-based startup logo (converted from PEW_FORMER_LOGO.svg)
- Animated space invaders with bobbing motion
- Enlarged heart symbols for better visibility
- Fixed keyboard page (proper 2-octave: 14 white, 10 black keys)
- Improved pattern number positioning
- Dynamic two-column list layouts
- Python SVG-to-code converter tool

---

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Startup Screen (StartupPage.cpp)
- **SVG Logo**: Converted 363√ó75 SVG to optimized 87√ó18px (45 rectangles)
- **Space Invaders**: 6 animated invaders (3 per side, 16√ó16px) with odd/even bobbing
- **Heart Symbols**: Enlarged 5√ó5 ‚Üí 9√ó7 pixels with y-4 offset for text alignment
- **Credits**: "WESTLICHT ‚ù§Ô∏è MODULOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è PHASERVILLE"

### Keyboard Page (KeyboardPage.cpp/h) - New
- **Proper 2-octave layout**: 14 white keys, 10 black keys
- **Black key positions**: [1,2,4,5,6,8,9,11,12,13]
- **Persistent last note display**
- **Info relocated to bottom**: Track/Root/Octave moved from top

### Pattern Page (PatternPage.cpp)
- **Fixed positioning**: Pattern numbers moved from y+13 to y+7 (subtract to move UP)

### List Pages (ListPage.cpp)
- **Dynamic column sizing**: Content-aware width calculation
- **No wasted space**: Column 0 gets exact width needed, column 1 fills remainder

## Previous Features (v0.0.50-0.0.62)

From commit 84ec511:

### 16-Track Support
- Dual bank system (tracks 1-8, 9-16)
- Extended MIDI routing
- Bank 2 LED distinction (red LEDs)
- Limitations: 8 patterns/track, 4 song slots

### 8 LFO Modulators
- Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Random shapes
- Waveform preview
- Routing popup for MIDI CC/Note mapping
- Triplet & dotted divisions

### Microtiming Recording
- timingQuantize parameter (0-100%)
- Captures gate timing offset (0-15)
- Blends natural feel with grid precision

### Performer Page Enhancements
- Pattern mode LEDs (Green=Active, Red=Muted, Yellow=Selected)
- Dimmed muted track numbers
- All-tracks 16-track view

---

## Developer Tools

### SVG to Logo Converter (svg_to_logo_converter.py)
- Input: SVG with rect elements + transforms
- Output: C++ fillRect() code + ASCII preview
- Features: Matrix math, preview modes (18/24/36px), rectangle merging
- Location: `~/Desktop/svg_to_logo_converter.py`

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Keyboard Layout (v0.0.56-58)
- Fixed: 16 white, 14 black ‚Üí 14 white, 10 black keys

### 2. Pattern Positioning (v0.0.61-62)
- Fixed: Y-axis inversion (subtract to move UP, not down)

### 3. Logo Boot Failure (v0.0.63 initial)
- Fixed: 2x scaling caused boot failure
- Solution: Proper SVG conversion with Python tool

## Comparison with Original Codebases

### westlicht/performer (Original)
- 8-track sequencer
- Core features all preserved in POW|FORMER

### djphazer/performer (PEW|FORMER)
- Updated toolchain (gcc 14.2)
- jackpf improvements (noise, shapes, MIDI)
- CI workflow

### modulove/performer (POW|FORMER) - Unique
- ‚≠ê 16-track system
- ‚≠ê 8 LFO modulators
- ‚≠ê Microtiming recording
- ‚≠ê Custom startup screen
- ‚≠ê Keyboard page
- ‚≠ê Enhanced performer page

### Features Removed: None
All core functionality preserved. Only limitations: 8 patterns/track (was 16) due to memory for 16 tracks.
